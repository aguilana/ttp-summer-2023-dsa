Hey there, awesome students! Buckle up and get ready to dive into the exciting world of Data Structures and Algortithms, with host, Kevin Yu. Now, let's talk about the three 'rules' that will make this journey even more enjoyable:

###### Rule #1

Respect the staff and your fellow students. We're a team, folks! Think of us as the Avengers of DSA, minus the capes (unless you have a cool one, then bring it on).

###### Rule #2

Bring your A-game and come prepared. We're not here for mediocrity, my friends. I want to see that Michael Jordan energy from each and every one of you. Lace up those coding sneakers and let's make magic happen!

Have fun, folks! If you're not having a blast while learning, we're doing something wrong. Laughter is the secret ingredient to unlock your coding superpowers, so let's enjoy the ride together!

Oh, and remember, if you stumble upon any issues or need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to any of the team! We're here to save the day and make your learning experience smooth like butter.

Alright, let's get this DSA party started! [Cue epic music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley)
